# **Graph Generation and Description with Q&A using GPT-2**
This repository contains a Python script that generates a graph based on a user-provided formula, describes the graph, and generates questions and answers related to the graph's description using GPT-2. The script leverages several libraries, including Matplotlib for graph plotting, NumPy for numerical operations, and the Transformers library for interacting with the GPT-2 language model.

## Features
Graph Generation: Users can input a mathematical formula, and the script will generate and display the corresponding graph.
Graph Description: The script automatically generates a description of the graph based on the formula, highlighting key features.
Q&A Generation: Using GPT-2, the script generates multiple questions and answers related to the graph's description.
